# First steps with pandas - workshop!

## Installation

Before participating in the workshop, please install all necessary libraries.

Probably it's good idea to install them in virtualenv.

Please use **Python 2.7**.

You can install libraries with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation, please run:

```
python check.py
```

After performing these steps, you are ready for the workshop :)
