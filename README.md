# First steps with pandas - workshop!

## Installation

Before participating in the workshop, please install all necessary libraries.

Probably it's good idea to install them in virtualenv.

We suggest using Python 3.6.1. It works also on 2.7.11. It is likely to work on most of "modern" Python versions.

You can install libraries with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation, please run:

```
python check.py
```

After performing these steps, you are ready for the workshop :)
